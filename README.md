# nbaAttendance

Trying to predict each NBA team's attendance this season (measured by average percent capacity of the stadium for home games) based on historical data. Potential factors that could influence this are the previous regular season success of the team, previous postseason performance, historical attendance rates, and the number of superstar players.

Each datapoint represents one team, one season. All-NBA "points" are gained in the following way: 3 points for a first team selection, 2 points for second team, 1 point for third team.

Each datapoint represents one team, one season. Teams earn one point for making the playoffs and can double their points every time they win a series, so teams that win only one series get 2 points, ... , and teams that win the championship get 16.
